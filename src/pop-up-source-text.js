This app only exists to help with some of the mechanics of running a solo game. The concepts and ideas behind it are old and extensively discussed in all sorts of places. Search rediit or read excellent books like **DM Yourself** by _Tom Scutt_. 

## About me
I'm a new RPG player and new programmer. This app is a small project that I made to practice my React.js skills. It isn't professional but it has helped me in my own solo games.

You can find me on [Github - jwhodge](https://github.com/jwhodge).

export const helpText = `# RPG Solitaire Engine - Basic Help

This tool aims to make it easier to play RPGs (especially D&D 5e) by yourself. It can be used to assist free-form solo play, where you create your world and story as you go, or help you play published adventures.

## The Tools
Right now there are 6 tools. While each is independent they are designed to be used in conjunction with each other. Each of the tools is explained in more detail below.

### The Oracle
The Oracle is the core of most solo play systems and helps to stop you from just saying "of course, my character can do that". 

The Oracle as it is used here is meant to tell you if it is possible to do something or if an NPC knows the answer you seek. It can only tell you these things, but you'll need to imagine or create the answers. 

**Example:** if you ask the oracle "Is it possible for the rogue to make his way all the way around the house without being seen?" the oracle can tell you **YES** that is possible **BUT** that it will cost the rogue to do this. 

You need to interpret it ... yes there are trees almost all the way around the house but in one section there is a muddy sewer drain the rogue can crawl in. 

You can choose a question or action as an option and then enter the text into the box following the popup guide. You can also set your advantage or disadvantage status if you want to. Then ask the oracle!

### Difficulty Check
This won't be new to most players. The Oracle tells you what's _possible_, but the difficulty check tells you if you actually succeed in doing it. 

You can choose the skill or ability you'd like to use and if you have advantage or disadvantage. Make your roll and add your modifiers, then check if you succeed.

**Example:** The rogue uses stealth and it's a normal roll. His total is 21 after adding his stealth bonus. He enters that and checks to find he succeeds on a hard check.

### Immersion
The Immersion tool is there to help ground you deeper into your location and story. You can roll this anytime you arrive in a new space or something changes. You can even roll it if you just feel like your story is losing its reality. 

There are options you can select. The best is to use the general clue and imagine your own cue. You can choose to have something more details or even choose a specific sense if you wish. 

**Example:** You use general and the cue is that you see something that stands out. You imagine this as the rogue sees that there is washing on the line outside the house. 

### Combat AI
This is not a true artificial intelligence but a shortcut to helping you make sure the NPCs you are fighting use realistic and relevant tactics. A spellcaster fights differently to an orc with a great-axe for example. 

You can choose from a series of different attacker types. Once you've selected one you can then suggested tactics based on how far they are from other combatants and how many hit points they have left. Low HP may mean that an attacker will run away rather than die for example. Most options are easy to understand but I suggest that low HP means 30-40% of the max HP of the attacker. 

### Random Combat Roll
The purpose of this one button tool is to introduce elements you didn't expect into your combat scenarios. Without a GM it isn't easy for the un expected to happen. This one button helps surprise you. 

I suggest that you give 'roll initiative for this button and see what it says each time its turn comes round. Much of the time it may not change anything but if it offers you an event try and go with it to see what happens to your combat.

### Dice Roller
This one is easy, it rolls one type of die and you can set it to do so with or without advantage or disadvantage.

## The Feed
Each of the tools above will add the result to the feed but as a player you can also use the input field at the bottom to write your own notes. This is especially useful to help you flesh out the simple answers from the oracle or keep a journal of your play by including it in the feed. Just type it in and hit submit.

### Markdown
The feed understand markdown which is a text formatting system that is easy to learn. Find an introductory guide on [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) where it is used extensively to quickly format online text without having to write HTML.


### Copying the feed
There is a button at the top which allows you to get a copy of the whole feed as text in markdown format. You can save this easily in any text file.`;
